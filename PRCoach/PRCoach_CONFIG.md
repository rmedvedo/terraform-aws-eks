# PRCoach Configuration File

## Overview
This configuration file outlines the preferences and settings for the GenAI-powered PR review service for Terraform. The configurations specified here will guide the automated code reviews, resource optimization recommendations, and other features provided by AppOne.

## PR Title and Description
- Replace the PR title as needed to reflect the content of the PR.
- Add to the PR submitter's description as needed, do not make description suggestions as a comment.

  - Build a knowledge base of common issues and solutions encountered in past reviews

- **KPI Tracking:**
  - Build dataset of total PR review cycle time: time from PR opening to close
  - Build dataset of fixes done by PR submitter after PR submission, before expert reviewer starts review
  - Build dataset of human reviewer cycle time: time from point of expert reviewer start to finish time


## Expert Reviewers
- **Designated Expert Reviewers:**
  - See file MAINTAINERS.md

## Continuous Improvement
The system will open Pull Requests against this configuration file to make updates based on learnings.
- **Feedback Loop:**
